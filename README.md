# vid2ascii

A simple tool that downloads a video from a URL and renders it as ASCII art directly in the terminal. Everything is implemented with pure Python packages so no external programs are required.

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the program and follow the prompts for the video URL and optional brightness, contrast, and saturation values. Press **Enter** to accept the defaults. The script is executable, so you can run it directly:

```bash
./vid2ascii.py
```

The script downloads the video and streams it in ASCII directly in your terminal.
